Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmobot.git
cd cosmobot
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

Install the required packages using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You can create a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing necessary packages like streamlit, openai, and python-dotenv.)

Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

plaintext
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.
